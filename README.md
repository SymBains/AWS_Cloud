# Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet, allowing users to access these resources on-demand without needing to manage physical infrastructure

### How do we know if something is in the Cloud (on-prem vs the cloud)
- **On-Prem**: Hosted on local servers within an organisation's infrastructure. (You own/manage physical hardware) 
- **Cloud**: Hosted on remote data centers and accessible via the internet.
- **Indicators**: Pay-as-you-go pricing, scalability, remote access, and managed services suggest a cloud environment.

### What are some popular cloud computing services and how are they used?
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** – Compute (EC2), Storage (S3), Databases (RDS)
- **Azure** – Virtual Machines, Blob Storage, AI & ML Services
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** – BigQuer(Data Warehouse), Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions

### Explain the four main cloud deployment models
| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Public** | Resources owned and managed by third-party providers |
| **Private** | Dedicated cloud for single organisation |
| **Hybrid** | Mix of public cloud + on-prem |
| **Multi-Cloud** | Using multiple cloud providers (redundancy and flexibility)|

### Explain the three main types of cloud service
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** – Virtual machines, storage, networking (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs).
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** – Managed development environments (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine).
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** – Cloud-hosted applications (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft 365).

### What are some of the main advantages of the cloud?
- Instant scalability & flexibility
- Cost efficiency (pay-as-you-go)
- Disaster recovery & backup
- Security & compliance
- Remote accessibility
- Global availability  
- Automatic updates  

### What are some potential pitfalls/disadvantages of using the cloud?
- Vendor lock-in risk - occurs when a customer becomes dependent on a specific vendor's products or services, making it difficult to switch to another supplier without significant costs, time, or disruption. 
- Unpredictable costs
- Latency & performance issues
- Loss of Control and Flexibility
- Lack of Customization
- Security and Privacy Concerns

### Which Cloud Provider is best? What are the big three known for?
| Cloud Provider | Key Strengths |
|---------------|--------------|
| **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** | - Global reach with extensive data centers. <br> - Broad service offering (web hosting, AI, analytics, IoT). <br> - Mature ecosystem with strong community support. |
| **Azure (Microsoft Azure)** | - Seamless integration with Microsoft products. <br> - Robust hybrid cloud capabilities. <br> - Strong focus on security and compliance. |
| **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)** | - Expertise in data analytics and machine learning. <br> - Leader in Kubernetes and containerization. <br> - High-performance global network for low-latency applications. |

### What sorts of thing do you usually pay for when using the cloud?
- Compute (VMs, containers, serverless functions)
- Storage (object storage, databases, backups)
- Networking (bandwidth, load balancing)
- Services (AI, analytics, monitoring, security)

### What are the four pillars of DevOps? How are they linked to cloud computing?
1. **Stability** – Cloud providers offer high availability, automated backups, and failover mechanisms to ensure system reliability.
2. **Scalability** – Cloud resources can be dynamically scaled to handle varying workloads, supporting DevOps automation.
3. **Speed** – Cloud-based CI/CD pipelines, serverless computing, and managed services accelerate software deployment and innovation.
4. **Security** – Cloud security tools (IAM, encryption, compliance monitoring) help DevOps teams enforce security best practices.

Cloud computing accelerates DevOps by enabling automation, scalability, and collaboration across distributed teams.
